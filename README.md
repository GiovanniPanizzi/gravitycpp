WORK IN PROGRESS
2D Planet Platformer with custom phisics, collision detection, editor.
Made with C++, SDL2 and OpenGL.
Game engine is a mix between OOP and ECS.
In main version everything kind of works but collisions are not the best. Rebuilding from new branch using cMake and openGL, collisions are way better.
